This is the content of my `~/.vim` directory. What do you do not see
here is my `~/.vimrc`. I do not make it a symlink to the `vimrc` file
in here. Rather, it is a script as well, one that simply ends with the
following line:

    runtime vimrc

That causes the `vimrc` from this directory to be loaded. That way
I have a place to keep non-public or very machine-specific bits of
configuration.
