This is the content of my `~/.vim` directory. What do you do not see
here is my `~/.vimrc`, because there isnâ€™t one. All my settings are in
`plugin/settings`, some extra gizmos are in `plugin/gizmos`, and some
filetype-specific settings are in `after/ftplugin`.

(Actually, I do have a `~/.vimrc`, but it is short and not versioned.
I keep keep non-public or very machine-specific configuration there.)
