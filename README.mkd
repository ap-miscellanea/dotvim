This is the content of my `~/.vim` directory. What do you do not see
here is my `~/.vimrc`, because there almost isnâ€™t one. Configuration
is spread across various files organized into directories like so:

- `plugin/config` for core Vim editor configuration
- `plugin/pluginprefs` for tweaking plugins
- `after/ftplugin` for any filetype-specific configuration

The `~/.vimrc` itself is short and not versioned. Its main content is the
single line `call util#unbundle()`. Otherwise I only keep keep non-public
or very machine-specific configuration there.
