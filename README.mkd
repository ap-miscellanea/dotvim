This is the content of my `~/.vim` directory. What do you do not see
here is my `~/.vimrc`, because there isn’t one. It’s spread across
files inside `plugin` directory, with some filetype-specific settings
in `after/ftplugin` and some extra gizmos in `bundle/gizmos`.

(Actually, I do have a `~/.vimrc`, but it is short and not versioned.
I keep keep non-public or very machine-specific configuration there.)
