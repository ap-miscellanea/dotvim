Usage by example:

  Type "5j" (without quotes) and then ";" to repeat "5j".
  Type "hjkl" and then ";", it still repeats "5j".
  Type "," to do "5k" (go in reverse direction).
  Type "4k" and then ";" to repeat "4k".

  The following motions (and scroll commands) are mapped per default:
      j,k, h,l, Ctrl-E,Ctrl-Y, zh,zl

Check out:

  Visual mode, e.g. "V5j;;;;"
  "f{char}" followed by ";," -- it should still work
  Operator pending mode with ";" and ","

Commands:

  :RepmoMap {motion}|{reverse-motion} ...

      Map {motion} to be repeatable with ";".  Use {reverse-motion} for ",".  Key notation is like in mappings.

Options, with defaults:

  " keys to be used for repeating (notation like in mappings), checked frequently:
  :let repmo_key = ";"
  :let repmo_revkey = ","

  " map some default motions (argument string for :RepmoMap):
  :let g:repmo_mapmotions = "j|k h|l <C-E>|<C-Y> zh|zl"

Notes:

  Your own remapping of a motion is silently discarded.
  Your own remappings for "f", "F", "t" and "T" are kept.
