INVOCATION COMMANDS~

:FileBeagle [{path}]                                              *:FileBeagle*
    Open the FileBeagle directory viewer on {path} or current working directory
    if {path} is not given.

:FileBeagleBufferDir                                     *:FileBeagleBufferDir*
    Open the FileBeagle directory viewer on the directory of the current
    buffer.

INVOCATION KEY MAPPINGS~

By default (unless |g:filebeagle_suppress_keymaps| is defined to be 1, the
following key maps are provided:

<leader>f   Invokes ":FileBeagle" with no arguments: open the directory viewer
            on the current working directory.

-           Invokes ":FileBeagleBufferDir": open the directory viewer
            on the directory of the current buffer.

If you want to define your own key mappings, then add something like the
following to your '~/.vimrc':
>
    let g:filebeagle_suppress_keymaps = 1
    map <silent> <Leader>f  <Plug>FileBeagleOpenCurrentWorkingDir
    map <silent> -          <Plug>FileBeagleOpenCurrentBufferDir
>

The above replicate the default key mappings. You should, of course,
substitute '<Leader>f' and '-' for whatever you prefer.

OPTIONS AND SETTINGS~

The list of file patterns to ignore can be controlled by setting
|wildignore|.

Other options are:

g:filebeagle_suppress_keymaps~                  *g:filebeagle_suppress_keymaps*
    Default: 0
    If specified as 1, then key-mappings to invoke FileBeagle will not be defined.


g:filebeagle_hijack_netrw~                          *g:filebeagle_hijack_netrw*
    Default: 1
    If specified as 0, directories will be opened by |netrw| instead of
    FileBeagle.

g:filebeagle_show_hidden~                          *g:filebeagle_show_hidden*
    Default: 0
    Show hidden and (wild-)ignored files by default (can be toggled when
    viewing a directory using 'gh').

g:filebeagle_show_line_numbers~           *g:filebeagle_show_line_numbers*
    Default: -1
    If 0, then line numbers (see |nu|) will be suppressed in the directory
    viewer (i.e, 'set nonumber' will be invoked). If 1, then line numbers will
    be explicitly activated (i.e, 'set number' will be invoked). If -1
    (default), then no number options will be explicitly set or unset.

g:filebeagle_show_line_relativenumbers~ *g:filebeagle_show_line_relativenumbers*
    Default: -1
    If 0, then relative line numbers (see |rnu|) will be suppressed in the
    directory viewer (i.e, 'set rnu' will be invoked). If 1, then relative
    line numbers will be explicitly activated (i.e, 'set nornu' will be
    invoked). If -1 (default), then no relative number options will be
    explicitly set or unset.
